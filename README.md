# MikroTik Firewall (Starting Point)

> This project provides a simple and functional example, which can and should be adjusted according to your environmentâ€™s needs.

## Prerequisites

1.  MikroTik RouterOS installed and accessible
2.  Access via Winbox or terminal (CLI)
3.  Basic understanding of firewall chains (input, forward, output)
4.  IP addressing configured on interfaces

## Features

- Allows essential traffic (DNS, ICMP, established/related connections)
- Blocks unwanted external traffic
- Basic protection rules for the WAN interface

## Notes

This project does not cover advanced scenarios (such as NAT, mangle, VPN, or layer-7 filters). The goal is **to provide a minimal secure baseline**.
